      Hello and welcome to my personal website. I am Software Engineering
      student at Flatiron School. This is website is where I will showcase what
      I have learned so far and will learn in the future in this program.

      I am 31 years old and a recent graduate of Nicholls State University. I
      found my love for programming while doing some basic coding in a business
      course about 6 months ago. I continued to learn a little bit of html & CSS
      on my own before deciding to enroll in Flatiron school. My hobbies outside
      of coding are reading, weightlifting, and spending time with my Corgi,
      Bloo.
